          also known as Baniqia (Arabic: بَانِيقِيَا‎), is a city in central Iraq about 160 km (100 mi) south of
          Baghdad. Its estimated population in 2013 was 1,000,000 people.[2] It is the capital of Najaf Governorate. It
          is widely considered the third holiest city of Shia Islam (after Mecca and Medina), the Shi'ite world's
          spiritual capital, and the center of Shi'ite political power in Iraq.[8] </p>

        <p class="text-muted text-left">Karbala or Kerbala (Arabic: كَرْبَلَاء‎, romanized: Karbalāʾ [karbaˈlaːʔ],
          /ˈkɑːrbələ/ KAR-bə-lə,[2][3] also US: /ˌkɑːrbəˈlɑː/ KAR-bə-LAH;[4][5]) is a city in central Iraq, located
          about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Baghdad, and a few miles east of Lake Milh, also known as Razzaza
          Lake.[6][7] Karbala is the capital of Karbala Governorate, and has an estimated population of 700,000 people
          (2015).

          The city, best known as the location of the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, or the shrines of Imam Husayn and
          Abbas,[8][9] is considered a holy city for Shi'ite Muslims, in the same way as Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.
          Tens of millions of Shi'ite Muslims visit the site twice a year, rivaling Mecca and Mashhad by the number of
          pilgrims annually.[10][11][12][13] The martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali is commemorated annually by millions of
          Shi'ites.[14][15][16][17] Up to 8 million pilgrims visit the city to observe ʿĀshūrāʾ (the tenth day of the
          month of Muharram), which marks the anniversary of Husayn's death, but the main event is the Arbaʿīn (the 40th
          day after 'Ashura'), where up to 30 million visit the graves. Most of the pilgrims travel on foot from all
          around Iraq and more than 56 countries.[18</p>

        <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Jamkaran Mosque</kbd></h4>

        <hr>

        <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">One day i will visit inshallah</h5>

        <p class="text-muted text-left">Overview and history
          The mosque, six kilometers east of Qom, has long been a sacred place, at least since 373 A.H., 17th of Ramadan
          (22 February 984 C.E.), when according to the mosque website, one Sheikh Hassan ibn Muthlih Jamkarani is
          reported to have met Muhammad al-Mahdi along with the prophet Al-Khidr. Jamkarani was instructed that the land
          they were on was "noble" and that the owner — Hasan bin Muslim — was to cease cultivating it and finance the
          building of a mosque on it from the earnings he had accumulated from farming the land.[1][2]

          Sometime in the decade of 1995-2005, the mosque's reputation spread, and many pilgrims, particularly young
          people, began to come to it. In the rear of the mosque, there is a "well of requests" where it is believed the
          Twelfth Imam once "became miraculously unhidden for a brief shining moment of loving communion with his
          Creator." Pilgrims tie small strings in a knot around the grids covering the holy well, which they hope will
          be received by the Imam Mahdi. Every morning custodians cut off the strings from the previous day.[3]

          Tuesday night is especially popular as it is said to be "the day the vision appeared and therefore the day of
          the week that [the Imam], although invisible, takes requests." The gathering "resembles a huge tailgate party
          where vendors set up in the parking lots and families set up picnic rugs and tens of thousands wander about
          the grounds as if waiting for the main event to happen."[4] More than a hundred thousand pilgrims sometimes
          pray outside the overflowing mosque for Maghrib prayer. In keeping with separation of the sexes, women are
          separated from men in their own special cordoned-off area and also have their own well.[4] Also on Tuesdays,
          the mosque kitchen provides a free evening meal to thousands of poor people.[3] One of the first acts of the
          government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was to donate £10 million to the mosque, to fund plans to turn
          "the normal-sized Jamkaran mosque into a massive complex of prayer halls, minarets, car parks and ablutions."
          In recent years, overseers of the Jamkaran compound have become sensitive to its foreign images and have
          restricted foreign press from the main mosque and well.[5]

          On 4 January 2020, a blood-red flag symbolizing vengeance unfurled above the dome in response to the 2020
          Baghdad International Airport airstrike. However, usually the red flag is raised during Muharram.[6]</p>

          <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it
            could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While
            it
            had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original
            better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly
            meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

                astronomers are launched on a wild trip to visit the eight planets in our solar system (per the
                International Astronomical Union’s 2006 decision to downgrade Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet),
                along with the Cat in the Hat, Thing One, Thing Two, Dick, and Sally. It’s a reading adventure that’s
                out
                of this world!<br>
